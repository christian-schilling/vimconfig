A collection of C extension Vim syntax files for
- xlib
- glib
- gobject
- gdk
- gdk-pixbuf
- gtk+
- atk
- pango
- cairo
- gimp
- libglade
- libgnome
- libgnomecanvas
- libgnomeui
- gtkglext
- vte
- linc
- gconf
- ORBit

They are extensions of the standard C syntax highlighting to additional
types, functions, macros, and constants, they are not meant to replace it.
So you should include them in your ~/.vim/after/syntax/c.vim file (see
:h runtimepath for more).  An example is provided as c.vim.example.

The xlib.vim file comes from older Gtk+ syntax higlighting files by Hwanjin
Choe (see http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=570).

The others were generated with vim-syn-gen.py script by David Neèas (Yeti)
(see http://trific.ath.cx/resources/vim/scripts/#vim-syn-gen).  They all
support `deprecated' option, e.g. by setting

  :let glib_enable_deprecated = 1

in your vimrc you can enable highlighting of deprecated declarations in glib.
Highlighting of deprecated declarations is off by default.

The exact library version from which each syntax file was generated is
included in its metadata.
